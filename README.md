First Computer Vision Project: utilizing YOLO11s and enhancing it with DeepSORT for car / person detection and implementing program to a private home security camera network.

Database of recent specific persons or vehicles spotted on camera, tracking their time of detection, how long they loiter in a specific area, how long they stay there, if the face or shape of the person is rocognizable, if the vehicle type or size and license plate is recognizable, as well as the vehicles speed to gauge suspition of tresspassing.  

I aim to train my own model of YOLO11 that can better view license plates, detect Board of Water Supply vehicles, UPS / Amazon vehicles, personal vehicles (direct family or known visitor's vehicles), and known faces.  This allows for specified alerts of who is driving through the road or if there is probability of a package being delivered or a better gauge of determining an unknown vehicle or person.  
- I will likely be using Google's Open Image Dataset V7 as well as a selfmade dataset for specifics.
- Hopefully utilize Roboflow Universe's License Plate Recognition Datasets to teach what to look for in object detection.
  - Probably will use Tesseract OCR for image-to-text translation for the license plates.
